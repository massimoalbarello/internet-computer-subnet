//! Data plane - Transport data path
//!
//! The data plane performs read/write QoS scheduling decisions across peer
//! connections, and performs socket IO. Once the control plane establishes a
//! peer connection, the socket is handed over to the data plane for IOs. As the
//! data plane performs the socket reads/writes, it also detects when a
//! connection is down. If a disconnect is detected, the control for the socket
//! is passed back to the control plane to attempt reconnection. On successful
//! reconnection, the socket is passed back to the data plane by the control
//! plane. The data plane is also responsible for detecting errors in the
//! connection (missing heartbeats, error notifications), and raising these to
//! the control plane. The data plane itself is composed of two async tasks per
//! connection: one each for send and receive. The connections established by
//! the control plane are split into read and write halves and given to these
//! two tasks.
//!
//! The data plane module implements data plane functionality for
//! [`TransportImpl`](../types/struct.TransportImpl.html).
